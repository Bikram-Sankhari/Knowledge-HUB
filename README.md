## Running the App - Guide
This Guide is for running the Web Application on your local server using GUNICORN.

However you can use any other WSGI server (e.g. - Hetzner) to serve the Flask Application. Also if you want to deploy the application on a remote server you should use a Reverse Proxy (e.g. - NGINX) in front of the WSGI Server.

### Prerequisites
- Python version 3.12 or higher
- Git Installed
- Email with third party app password


#### 1. Make a Clone of this repo at your preferred location

	git clone https://github.com/Bikram-Sankhari/Knowledge-HUB.git

#### 2. Open the just cloned "Knowledge-HUB" directory in terminal

#### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

	python -m venv env

#### 4. Activate the Virtual Evironment
##### for Windows:

	env\Scripts\activate

##### for Linux:

	source env/bin/activate

#### 5. Install the required packages

	pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 6. Set environment variables
- Create a copy of the '.env-sample' file in the root directory of the project and rename the copy to ".env"
- Enter your credentials in the respective fields

#### 7. Start serving the Flask Application using Gunicorn

	gunicorn --bind=127.0.0.1:8000 main:app

## Open [127.0.0.1:8000](127.0.0.1:8000) on your browser.
